[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

An independent, open-source build based on **SideStore** and **LiveContainer**, focused on reliable same-device refresh, clear scheduling, verification, and beginner-friendly setup.

Two variants are available: **standalone SideStore** and **LiveContainer with this modified SideStore embedded**. A computer is needed for the initial install and pairing setup. After that, the stable refresh path is designed to run on the iPhone without keeping the computer connected.

## Stable baseline 3.0.2.1

This fork freezes the verified iPad deployment on `release/3.0.2.1`.
Use [3.0.2.1 release notes](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.0.2.1.md) for exact source pins,
existing IPA identity and the device test matrix. The release reuses build
[36748073104](https://github.com/fanonym/sidestore-auto-refresh/actions/runs/36748073104);
no new application build is needed for this documentation closure.

Verified configuration:

- Pairing: **RPP-only** (recommended).
- LocalDevVPN Tunnel IP: **`10.7.0.1`**; Device/Peer IP: **`10.7.0.2`**.
- SideStore **Use Local VPN: ON**.
- **Remote Pairing Port Override: `0`**.
- SideInstaller DNS may remain **Automatic** for normal operation.
- Internal LiveContainer **Auto-refresh is OFF, unused and not recommended for this deployment**.

These VPN endpoints stay the same across the verified Wi-Fi networks and hotspot.
True Hairpin and Lockdown/CoreDevice on port `62078` are historical/experimental
paths, not the recommended 3.0.2.1 configuration. Their implementation remains
in the frozen source; no network-layer changes are part of this release closure.

Home Wi-Fi **PASS**, Wi-Fi 2 **PASS**, hotspot **PASS**, sleep/wake **PASS**,
and Shortcuts refresh **PASS**, as reported by the deployment owner. A hotspot
means the iPad joins the hotspot over Wi-Fi; this is not cellular-only proof.
Check the remaining signing lifetime on **LC Home** after refresh. LC logs do
not populate in this deployment and are not a required verification source.

## Recommended Refresh via Shortcuts

Use iPadOS Shortcuts for the verified deployment:

1. Optionally disconnect the specific active external VPN (WireGuard or CyberGhost).
2. **Disable LocalDevVPN**.
3. **Wait 2 seconds**.
4. **Enable LocalDevVPN**.
5. **Wait 10 seconds**.
6. Run **Refresh All Apps**.
7. **Wait 10 seconds**.
8. **Disable LocalDevVPN**.

Configure an automation with **Time of Day**, repeat **Daily**, **Run Immediately**,
and **Show When Run: OFF**. Notifications are optional. The deployment owner
verified scheduled refresh after sleep/wake with this setup.

LocalDevVPN needs to be active only during the refresh window. Restore
WireGuard/CyberGhost manually as needed afterwards. Confirm the remaining
signing lifetime on LC Home; launching the shortcut alone is not proof of refresh.

The verified refresh path is:

```text
Shortcuts -> Refresh All Apps -> RPPairing -> RSD
    -> provisioning/profile install -> REFRESH_VERIFIED
```

## v3 unified combined application

The v3 branch launches into one **Home, Apps, Sources, Refresh, and Settings** interface. Apps includes LiveContainer guests and SideStore-installed apps with separate typed identities. Sources supports SideStore catalogs, source addition/removal, app details, installation and updates.

SideStore commands run in its existing LiveProcess service. Authentication, certificates, pairing and advanced signing controls appear inside the unified application's operation sheet, without its legacy tab bar. SideStore retains database, Keychain, authentication, signing and installation authority; the host retains guest runtime and refresh orchestration.

Combined v3 uses LiveContainerSupport SideStore `ff25922e5c13ccfafd83bda5092910d848ebd409`, upstream minimuxer `98c3c79982f813878e922ab42f9545314a700f0c` and SideSign `a731c0d5a9a6617c7b385ae493e07ffb7f81cd5d`. CI verifies that GSA fix `35993d7f68950ce00d6bf1fd0fbcaa7bef51dc9c` is in SideSign's ancestry. There is no independent SideSign override or authentication backport. Standalone is unchanged by this migration.

For v3 setup, use **Settings → Account and Signing → Sign In / Authenticate**, then **Settings → SideStore → Import Pairing File** if needed. Configure LocalDevVPN, run **Refresh**, and check the remaining lifetime on LC Home. Leave internal Auto-refresh OFF and use the Shortcuts workflow above. Apps' per-app Refresh actions also route to that tab. Guest Return, Start Collapsed, custom colors and all three layouts retain their existing preference keys.

**Historical startup investigation:** Startup-recovery candidates were built on `fix/v3-startup-errors`; use the full builder SHA and matching CI evidence attached to the draft, not a mutable branch as package identity. Settings > Build Candidate reports the product line, builder commit and run. Install over the existing combined app with matching signing identity and app identifiers; no reset is part of the upgrade. List, Grid and Compact List retain `LCAppLayoutStyle`. Physical-device acceptance is separate from CI evidence. Those historical draft candidates have separate identities; the frozen 3.0.2.1 baseline is identified above.

The [startup crash investigation](docs/COMBINED_STARTUP_CRASH.md) records the exact binary match and remaining device uncertainty. Both corrected combined lines include Issue #24 error propagation; standalone packages retain their separate provenance. Upstream GSA integration does not establish that all login failures or HTTP 429 are resolved.

See [the v3 architecture document](docs/V3_UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the implementation, ownership, upstream authentication review and validation details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current stable refresh path requires **Wi-Fi + the official App Store LocalDevVPN**. Cellular-only refresh is experimental and is not part of the stable release.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not an official SideStore or LiveContainer release. For stock behavior and upstream support, use the official [SideStore](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore) and [LiveContainer](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer) projects.

## What is this?

This project is a modified SideStore / LiveContainer build that makes same-device refresh easier to operate and easier to verify.

It adds:

- manual refresh directly on the iPhone
- six-hour, daily, and weekly refresh schedules
- preferred refresh time controls
- persistent refresh history
- bounded retry and recovery logic
- explicit refresh verification
- a same-device **LocalDevVPN + RPP-only** refresh path for 3.0.2.1
- a combined LiveContainer build with the modified SideStore already embedded
- guest Return controls in the combined build
- **Start Collapsed** and **custom Return button colors** in combined v2.1.0

The goal is simple: after the initial installation and pairing setup, normal refresh should happen on the iPhone without leaving a PC connected.

## Preview

## Which version should I download?

For this fork's verified deployment, use **3.0.2.1**, reusing the IPA from
[build 36748073104](https://github.com/fanonym/sidestore-auto-refresh/actions/runs/36748073104).
The [release notes](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.0.2.1.md) identify its exact checksum.
The frozen [3.0.2.1 release](https://github.com/fanonym/sidestore-auto-refresh/releases/tag/v3.0.2.1)
provides the unchanged IPA and matching build evidence. SideStore is embedded;
a separate SideStore installation is not required for this combined setup.

Earlier upstream downloads and the v1/v2 instructions below are historical
references, not the recommended 3.0.2.1 deployment procedure.

## What's new in v1.0.4 and v2.1.1?

Issue 17 adds saved app layout choices under **Interface**:

- **List** keeps the detailed card layout.
- **Grid** shows an icon-first app grid. You can hide visual labels while keeping each app name available to VoiceOver.
- **Compact List** uses shorter rows for denser browsing.

The selected layout and label preference persist across launches. Changing either setting refreshes the Apps screen immediately. Grid actions continue to use the existing launch, multitasking, context-menu, confirmation, and error-handling paths.

The combined-build Issue #25 correction supplies a content-derived Grid sizing
contract, including the iOS 15 intrinsic/preferred-size path, scaled labels and a
visible missing-icon fallback. Compact List now sizes its icon and content to its
row. Existing `LCAppLayoutStyle` and `LCShowAppLabels` values are preserved.
[Layout verification](docs/issue25-layout-verification.md) separates measured
simulator reproduction and regression evidence from pending physical-device tests.

## What's new in standalone v1.0.3?

Standalone v1.0.3 updates the app to **SideStore 0.7.0 nightly**, including the newer **SideSign authentication path**.

- Preserves LocalDevVPN -> Lockdown/CoreDevice -> RSD transport, manual refresh, scheduled refresh, history, retries, and verification.
- Composite pairing records prefer Lockdown/CoreDevice, and this path works with LocalDevVPN without an additional IKEv2/IPsec interface.
- Adapts signing instrumentation and background database startup to the SideStore 0.7 APIs.
- Records self-refresh reconciliation success only after the database update succeeds.

The IPA build, automated checks, and published-download verification passed. Device testing of this exact v1.0.3 build is still pending; earlier standalone device evidence is listed separately below. See the [release notes](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.3.md) for exact source revisions and validation.

## What's new in v2.1.0?

Combined v2.1.0 keeps the existing v2 refresh stack and adds new Guest Return appearance controls:

- **Start Collapsed:** guests can open with the Return control already collapsed to an edge tab.
- **Use Custom Colors:** enables saved custom colors for the Return control.
- **Icon Color:** changes the Return icon and the collapsed tab icon.
- **Button Background:** changes the expanded Return button background.
- Guest-control appearance preferences persist across launches.
- Manual long-press collapse and tap-to-expand behavior remain available.
- The collapsed tab stays transparent while using the selected icon color.

The release still includes manual refresh, scheduled refresh, refresh history, verification, LocalDevVPN/CoreDevice transport, and the embedded SideStore integration.

## How this project differs from the original projects

This repository builds on upstream work. It does not claim to have invented SideStore background refresh or the LiveContainer + SideStore concept.

- **Upstream SideStore already supports sideloading and periodic background refresh.**
- **Upstream LiveContainer already offers a build with SideStore included.**

The purpose of this repository is to add a specific refresh transport, scheduling, verification, diagnostics, and LiveContainer integration on top of pinned upstream revisions.

| Area | Original / upstream behavior | This project adds or changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SideStore refresh | SideStore already resigns and refreshes apps | The recommended **LocalDevVPN + RPP-only** route in 3.0.2.1; historical CoreDevice diagnostics remain in source |
| Scheduling | Upstream SideStore already has background refresh behavior | Explicit **six-hour, daily, and weekly** schedules, preferred time controls, persistent history, bounded retry, and deadline protection |
| Verification | Normal upstream refresh state and results | Run-correlated verification so task launch or handoff is not treated as refresh success by itself |
| Combined LiveContainer build | Upstream already offers LiveContainer + SideStore | Embeds this repository's modified SideStore and adds host-level refresh coordination, result bridging, startup/authentication fixes, and shared-Keychain handling |
| Guest navigation | Upstream LiveContainer provides its normal guest controls | Adds project-specific Return controls, collapse behavior, startup-collapsed mode, and custom colors |
| Guest signature diagnostics | Upstream behavior differs | Keeps guest signature checks advisory so an unrelated guest check cannot overwrite a verified successful refresh |
| Provenance | Upstream releases are built by their own projects | Published binaries here are tied to documented builder commits, CI runs, checksums, and verification evidence |

### What this project does not change

- It does **not** remove the normal Personal Team signing expiration. It refreshes before expiration.
- It does **not** guarantee an exact background execution time. iOS controls task scheduling.
- It does **not** make cellular-only refresh a stable feature yet.
- It does **not** require a jailbreak for the supported stable path.
- It does **not** make LiveContainer guests equivalent to separately installed iOS apps.
- It does **not** guarantee that iOS will keep every guest process alive.

Because the combined build modifies LiveContainer and contains embedded SideStore code, use the same trust model you would use for any modified LiveContainer build. This repository is open source, and you can [build it yourself](#build-it-yourself) if you prefer to verify the build path personally.

## Historical v1/v2 setup at a glance

For 3.0.2.1, use the stable configuration and Shortcuts sections above. The following installer and v1/v2 steps preserve earlier release instructions, including their different pairing, routing and scheduler assumptions.

```text
Choose v1 or v2
    -> install iLoader
    -> connect and trust the iPhone
    -> Import IPA
    -> trust the sideloaded app
    -> enable Developer Mode
    -> place pairing data with iLoader
    -> install and configure LocalDevVPN
    -> run one manual refresh
    -> enable automatic refresh
```

## Recommended installer

For beginners, the recommended example installer is **[iLoader](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest)**.

Official project: [github.com/nab138/iloader](https://github.com/nab138/iloader)

Use **iLoader 2.3.1 or newer** for current SideStore / LiveContainer installation flows.

It is a good fit because it can:

- import and sign a custom IPA
- detect and select the connected iPhone
- manage pairing data
- place pairing files into supported SideStore-compatible apps
- run on Windows, macOS, and Linux

The important point is to use **Import IPA** with the IPA downloaded from this repository. iLoader also offers built-in upstream SideStore and LiveContainer + SideStore installers, but those are not this project's modified builds.

### Windows prerequisite

Make sure Apple's device drivers are installed before using iLoader. iLoader's documented Windows path uses iTunes. Connect the iPhone by USB, unlock it, and tap **Trust** when iOS asks whether to trust the computer.

If iLoader cannot see the device, verify that Apple's software can see it before troubleshooting this project.

## What you need

Before starting, have the following ready:

- an iPhone or iPad supported by the build you want to test
- a Free Apple Account / Personal Team for signing
- a Windows, macOS, or Linux computer for the initial setup
- a USB cable for installation and pairing
- [iLoader](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest), or another compatible installer
- the official [LocalDevVPN on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localdevvpn/id6755608044), by **Coxson Engineering LLC**
- a Wi-Fi network

See [Compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) for the current device evidence. You do not need to understand CoreDevice, RSD, TLS, or CDTunnel before using the project.

## Global first-time setup

These steps apply to **both standalone v1 and combined v2**. Complete this section first, then finish the short setup for the variant you installed.

### 1. Download the IPA

Choose exactly one build for the setup you want:

**Combined LiveContainer + SideStore v2.1.1**

[Download `LiveContainer-SideStore-AutoRefresh.ipa`](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/releases/download/v2.1.1/LiveContainer-SideStore-AutoRefresh.ipa)

**Standalone SideStore v1.0.4**

[Download `SideStore.ipa`](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/releases/download/v1.0.4/SideStore.ipa)

### 2. Install iLoader and connect the device

1. Download the latest [iLoader release](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest).
2. Connect the iPhone to the computer by USB.
3. Unlock the iPhone and leave it unlocked during the initial setup.
4. Tap **Trust** on the iPhone if the computer trust prompt appears.
5. Open iLoader.
6. Under the device section, select the connected iPhone.
7. Sign in to your Apple Account. iLoader currently labels this section **Apple ID**.

### 3. Import and install this project's IPA

In iLoader:

1. Find the **Installers** section.
2. Click **Import IPA**.
3. Select the v1 or v2 IPA you downloaded from this repository.
4. Let iLoader sign and install it with your Apple Account.
5. Wait for the installation to finish before disconnecting the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not select iLoader's built-in stock **SideStore** or **LiveContainer + SideStore** build if your goal is to install this repository. Use **Import IPA** and choose the file downloaded from this repository.

### 4. Trust the sideloaded app on iPhone

If the installed app will not open or iOS shows **Untrusted Developer**:

`Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management`

Under **Developer App**, select the Apple Account used to sign the IPA, then tap **Trust**.

### 5. Enable Developer Mode

Go to:

`Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Developer Mode`

Turn **Developer Mode** on. iOS may restart the device. After reboot, confirm **Turn On** if requested.

### 6. Place the pairing file with iLoader

A pairing file is the trust record that lets SideStore authenticate with the same iPhone it is running on. It must belong to the exact physical device you are setting up.

Keep the iPhone connected by USB and unlocked. Then in iLoader:

1. Open the **Management** section.
2. Open **Manage Pairing File**.
3. If the newly installed app is not shown, click **Rescan Installed Apps**.
4. Find the installed SideStore-compatible app.
5. Click **Place** next to that app. You can use **Place In All Apps** if that is intentionally what you want.
6. Wait for **Pairing file placed successfully!** before continuing.

> [!CAUTION]
> Pairing files contain private device credentials. Never upload them to GitHub, Discord, an issue report, a public file host, or a screenshot.

If pairing later fails, reconnect the same device by USB and repeat **Manage Pairing File -> Place** before changing unrelated settings.

### 7. Install the correct LocalDevVPN

Install the official **[LocalDevVPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localdevvpn/id6755608044)** from the App Store.

Check the developer name: **Coxson Engineering LLC**.

LocalDevVPN creates the local virtual route used by the stable same-device refresh path. VPN Super and an additional IKEv2/IPSec tunnel are not required for this project's current stable CoreDevice path.

### 8. Find the iPhone's Wi-Fi subnet

LocalDevVPN must use addresses from the **same IPv4 subnet** as the Wi-Fi network currently joined by the iPhone.

On iPhone:

`Settings -> Wi-Fi -> tap the info button next to the connected network`

Look at both:

- **IP Address**
- **Subnet Mask**

Example:

```text
IP Address:  192.168.1.50
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

That example is the `192.168.1.x/24` subnet.

> [!WARNING]
> If your subnet mask is not `255.255.255.0` and you are not sure which addresses belong to the subnet, do not guess. Check your router configuration or ask for help with the exact IP address and subnet mask.

### 9. Choose two unused addresses

You need two unused IPv4 addresses in that same subnet. The safest approach is to check the router's DHCP range or connected-client list and choose addresses that are not assigned to another device.

Example only for `192.168.1.x/24`:

```text
Tunnel IP: 192.168.1.240/32
Device IP: 192.168.1.241/32
```

Do not use:

- the iPhone's actual IP address
- the router or gateway address
- an IP currently assigned to another device
- an address outside the iPhone's current Wi-Fi subnet

### 10. Configure LocalDevVPN

Open:

`LocalDevVPN -> Settings -> Network Configuration`

Then:

1. Enter the chosen **Tunnel IP** with `/32`.
2. Enter the chosen **Device IP** with `/32`.
3. Enable **Allow Intermediate Addresses**.
4. Tap **Done**.
5. Tap **Save & Apply**.
6. Connect LocalDevVPN.
7. Open **Session Details** and confirm the custom addresses were retained.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you move to a Wi-Fi network with a different subnet, update the Tunnel IP and Device IP before refreshing again.

### 11. Enable Background App Refresh

Go to:

`Settings -> General -> Background App Refresh`

Make sure Background App Refresh is enabled globally and for the relevant installed app when iOS exposes a per-app toggle.

Allow notifications if you want refresh status and deadline warnings.

## Combined setup (v2)

Use this section only for **LiveContainer + SideStore v2.1.1**.

### 1. Open LiveContainer and embedded SideStore

Open **LiveContainer**, then open the embedded **SideStore**.

Sign into SideStore with the Apple Account you use for SideStore.

### 2. Run one manual refresh first

Open:

`LiveContainer -> SideStore Refresh -> Refresh SideStore now`

Keep Wi-Fi and LocalDevVPN available while the test runs.

**Do not enable scheduled refresh until this manual refresh succeeds.**

If host replacement closes or relaunches LiveContainer, reopen it and let verification finish. A handoff or background-task launch is not considered success by itself.

### 3. Enable automatic refresh

Open LiveContainer's SideStore refresh settings and enable automation.

Choose one of the supported schedules:

- Six-hour
- Daily
- Weekly

**Daily or Six-hour is recommended** because it gives iOS more opportunities to run before the normal seven-day Personal Team signing window expires.

The selected time is a **target deadline**, not an exact alarm. iOS controls when background work actually starts and may delay or omit a background launch.

## Standalone setup (v1)

Use this section for **standalone SideStore v1.0.4**.

### 1. Open SideStore

Open SideStore and sign in with the Apple Account you use for SideStore.

### 2. Run one manual refresh first

Keep Wi-Fi and LocalDevVPN connected, then perform a normal manual refresh. Confirm that the refresh succeeds before enabling automation.

### 3. Enable automatic refresh

Open:

`SideStore -> Settings -> Refreshing Apps -> Refresh Schedule`

Choose a schedule and verify the result in refresh history after the next run.

The standalone build supports manual, six-hour, daily, and weekly refresh options. The selected time is not a guaranteed iOS alarm. Background execution is controlled by iOS.

## Historical v1/v2 daily use

Once setup is working:

- keep Wi-Fi available
- keep LocalDevVPN correctly configured and connected when possible
- keep Background App Refresh enabled
- check refresh history occasionally for successful runs
- update the LocalDevVPN addresses if you move to a different Wi-Fi subnet

A computer should not normally be required during refresh runtime after initial setup.

Cellular-only refresh is not currently supported by the stable release.

## Updating without losing setup data

### Combined v2

Install the new combined IPA **over the existing LiveContainer installation** using the same Apple Account / Personal Team and matching identifiers.

**Do not delete LiveContainer first.** Back up important guest data before updating.

### Standalone v1

Install a new standalone SideStore build over the existing matching SideStore installation.

**Do not delete SideStore first.** Replacing the installation helps preserve pairing data, Apple account state, and the SideStore database.

Do not install the standalone IPA over LiveContainer. Standalone-to-combined data migration is not provided.

## Troubleshooting

For **3.0.2.1**, check RPP-only pairing, Tunnel `10.7.0.1`, Device/Peer
`10.7.0.2`, Use Local VPN ON and Port Override `0`. Cycle LocalDevVPN with the
Shortcuts delays above and disconnect a conflicting external VPN. Do not change
the endpoints to match a new Wi-Fi subnet or switch to CoreDevice/62078.
Check LC Home for the signing lifetime; empty LC logs are expected in this
deployment. Keep internal LC Auto-refresh OFF. SideInstaller DNS can be Automatic.

### Historical v1/v2 troubleshooting

The following table applies to the older CoreDevice setup only.

| Problem | Check this first |
| --- | --- |
| iLoader does not see the iPhone on Windows | Confirm Apple's device drivers are installed, reconnect USB, unlock the phone, and tap **Trust** |
| iLoader says no device is selected | Select the iPhone in iLoader before running **Import IPA** or pairing actions |
| App shows Untrusted Developer | `Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management -> Developer App -> Trust` |
| App will not open | Confirm Developer Mode is enabled in `Settings -> Privacy & Security` |
| Pairing error | Reconnect USB, open **Manage Pairing File**, use **Rescan Installed Apps**, then **Place** again for the exact device |
| LocalDevVPN will not connect | Recheck Network Configuration, both `/32` endpoints, and **Allow Intermediate Addresses** |
| LocalDevVPN connects but refresh fails | Confirm the addresses are in the iPhone's current Wi-Fi subnet and are not already in use |
| Refresh stopped after changing Wi-Fi | Reconfigure Tunnel IP and Device IP for the new subnet |
| Manual refresh fails | Confirm Wi-Fi, LocalDevVPN, pairing, SideStore sign-in, and the recorded refresh result/history |
| Scheduled refresh was missed | Confirm manual refresh works and Background App Refresh is enabled. The selected time is not an exact wake time |
| Not enough App IDs | Free Apple Accounts have registration limits. Do not repeatedly delete/reinstall builds. Wait for registrations to expire or reuse matching identifiers where supported |
| Guest signature warning | The warning is separate from verified refresh status. Open the named guest and report whether it actually launches |
| Cellular-only refresh fails | Cellular-only transport is experimental and is not supported by the stable release |

For deeper investigation, see [Verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md), [Compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md), and [Issue #1](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/issues/1).

## Guest Return behavior

| Execution mode | Return behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Windowed LiveProcess multitasking | Floating Return button is hidden. Use the normal window controls. |
| Fullscreen or maximized LiveProcess | Return activates or minimizes back to the host without intentionally terminating the guest. |
| Retained guest reopened | The existing instance is reused when it is still alive. Stale instances are cleaned before a cold launch. |
| Direct host-process guest | Uses the existing restart-return path. Guest memory is not preserved. |

Long-press the Return button to collapse it to an edge tab. Tap the tab to restore it. Its position is saved and clamped after resizing.

v2.1.0 adds these options in **LiveContainer Settings > Guest Controls**:

- **Start Collapsed:** new guests open with an edge tab. Tap once to expand, then tap Return to go back. Using Return collapses the control again, including when reopening a retained guest. The option is off by default.
- **Use Custom Colors:** choose the **Icon Color** and **Button Background**. The icon color also applies to the collapsed tab; the tab background stays transparent. Turn this option off to restore system colors. Color choices are saved for later use.

These preferences apply to both fullscreen LiveProcess and direct host-process guests. **Show Return Button** still controls visibility, and windowed multitasking still uses the normal window controls.

## Technical architecture

The recommended 3.0.2.1 runtime is **Shortcuts → Refresh All Apps → RPPairing →
RSD → provisioning/profile install → REFRESH_VERIFIED**. Internal scheduler and
CoreDevice code remain present but are not the deployed operating procedure.

### Historical CoreDevice architecture

```text
LiveContainer triggers / embedded SideStore
    -> refresh coordination and eligibility
    -> Wi-Fi / LocalDevVPN preflight
    -> signing and refresh pipeline
    -> Lockdown -> CoreDeviceProxy TLS -> CDTunnel
    -> userspace adapter -> RSD
    -> AFC staging / InstallationProxy and profile operations
    -> correlated verification results and history
```

The historical CoreDevice implementation preserves service TLS, contiguous CDTunnel writes, heartbeat during transport operations, packet-size and flow-control fixes, and corrected FFI ownership. Experimental cellular work is not part of the current stable product path.

### App Layout architecture (Issue #17)

Issue #17 is intentionally a **presentation-layer feature**. It must not modify the refresh transport, signing, authentication, background scheduling, database reconciliation, or CoreDevice pipeline.

```text
Interface settings
    -> persisted AppLayoutPreferences
        -> App Layout: list | grid | compactList
        -> Show app labels: true | false
    -> Apps screen presentation switch
        -> List renderer
        -> Grid renderer
        -> Compact List renderer
    -> shared app model + shared actions
        -> open / refresh / activate / deactivate / context menu
```

The implementation contract is:

- Add a small persisted layout model, for example `AppLayoutStyle: String`, with `list`, `grid`, and `compactList` cases.
- Keep **List** as the default so existing installs retain today's behavior.
- Persist `appLayoutStyle` and `showAppLabels` through SideStore's existing preferences/UserDefaults mechanism. Do not add a new database for UI preferences.
- Extend the existing **Interface -> App Layout** setting instead of creating a second layout control. Show **Show app labels** only when Grid is selected.
- Keep the current list/card renderer as the List path. Do not rewrite working list behavior simply to share code.
- Implement Grid as an icon-first adaptive grid, with an optional app name below each icon.
- Implement Compact List with the same app data and actions as List, but with reduced icon size, row height, and vertical padding.
- Route all three renderers through the same existing app model and action handlers. Layout-specific views must not duplicate signing, refresh, activation, installation, or context-menu business logic.
- Hiding Grid labels is visual only. The app name must remain available as an accessibility label.
- Treat [SideloadLabs/AppNest](https://github.com/SideloadLabs/AppNest) as a visual reference only. Do not vendor or copy its implementation unless its code and license are reviewed separately.

#### Patch strategy

This repository should implement the feature as a deterministic build-time patch, consistent with the rest of the project. The expected implementation is a dedicated semantic patch such as `scripts/patch_app_layout.py` that targets the pinned SideStore source rather than vendoring whole upstream files.

Standalone and combined builds currently consume different SideStore source lines. The UI contract should remain the same, but source-specific anchors/adapters may be used where their view structure differs. Do not upgrade the embedded LiveContainer SideStore to official SideStore 0.7 solely to deliver this UI feature.

The patch must be idempotent and fail closed if upstream anchors move. It should touch only the minimum settings/preferences and Apps-screen presentation surface needed for the feature.

#### Verification gates

Before Issue #17 is considered complete:

1. Repository tests prove the patch is idempotent and rejects changed/ambiguous upstream anchors.
2. Generated Swift parses successfully and the build completes for every supported target that receives the feature.
3. List, Grid, Grid without visual labels, and Compact List are all reachable from settings.
4. Layout and label preferences survive relaunch.
5. Open, refresh, activation/deactivation, status display, and context-menu actions still use the same underlying handlers in every layout.
6. Accessibility still exposes the app name when Grid labels are hidden.
7. No transport, signing, authentication, scheduler, or CoreDevice source is changed by this feature.
8. Device screenshots/acceptance checks cover all three layouts before release.

This separation keeps Issue #17 low risk: the renderer changes, while the app lifecycle and refresh stack remain the same.

## Verification status

For 3.0.2.1: home Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 2, hotspot, sleep/wake and Shortcuts refresh
are all owner-reported **PASS**. The IPA checksum was independently matched to
the existing successful build during release closure. See the
[baseline record](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v3.0.2.1.md).

### Historical v1/v2 evidence

| Scope | Current evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Standalone v1.0.4 build and packaging | CI passed; published IPA checksum, arm64 executable, background-task configuration, and layout patch parsing verified |
| Standalone v1.0.3 device refresh | Device testing of this exact build is pending |
| Earlier standalone manual CoreDevice refresh | Verified on iPhone 12 / iOS 26.6.1; this predates v1.0.3 |
| Earlier standalone scheduled refresh with PC disconnected | Recorded proof predates v1.0.3 and is available in the verification report |
| Combined v2.1.1 build and packaging | Combined CI run completed successfully, including the LiveContainer grid implementation |
| v2.1.0 Guest Controls | Start Collapsed and custom colors are included in the published combined build |
| Background scheduling | Best effort. iOS controls task launch timing |
| Cellular-only refresh | Experimental, not supported in the stable release |
| Guest process retention | Best effort. iOS may suspend or terminate a guest |

A build completing, a background task starting, or a host handoff occurring is not automatically treated as proof that the signing lifetime was refreshed. See [docs/VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md) for the exact proof model.

## Build it yourself

This repository contains build-time patches rather than permanent vendored copies of LiveContainer and SideStore. Workflows fetch pinned upstream revisions.

1. Fork the repository and enable GitHub Actions.
2. Run **LiveContainer embedded SideStore build** for the combined IPA, or **Build Current SideStore** for standalone.
3. For reproducing 3.0.2.1, use the immutable builder commit `b9590618dac5a791d2faffa9365d00bbfaa50776`, not `main`. Release closure reuses the existing IPA and does not run this build procedure.
4. Download the successful run artifact.
5. Sign the resulting IPA with your own Apple Account / Personal Team before installing it.

## Development checks

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
git diff --check
```

Compiler-dependent tests require their toolchains. Source and static checks do not replace real-device validation.

## Security, privacy, licensing, and support

Never publish pairing files, Apple credentials, private keys, personal signed IPAs, unnecessary device identifiers, or complete private device logs.

The combined build can access data used by LiveContainer and its guests according to LiveContainer's architecture. If the trust model matters to you, review the source and build the IPA yourself.
