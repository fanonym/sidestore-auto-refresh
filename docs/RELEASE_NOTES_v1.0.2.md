# SideStore CoreDevice Auto-Refresh v1.0.2

> **3.0.2.1 deployment:** See [the frozen baseline and test matrix](RELEASE_NOTES_v3.0.2.1.md)
> and [recommended Shortcuts refresh](../README.md#recommended-refresh-via-shortcuts).
> RPP-only pairing is recommended; internal LC Auto-refresh is unused. True Hairpin
> and CoreDevice/62078 are historical/experimental, not this deployment's recommendation.
> Older release evidence and pending issue-specific checks below retain their original scope;
> they neither override the 3.0.2.1 configuration nor gain new PASS results from its refresh tests.

This release delivers the verified SideStore build with same-device CoreDevice refresh and bounded on-device diagnostic logging. It is designed for a Free Apple Account / Personal Team, the official App Store LocalDevVPN, Wi-Fi, a valid pairing file, and Developer Mode.

## Installation

Install the IPA over the existing SideStore installation. Do not delete SideStore first; replacing it preserves pairing data, account state, and the SideStore database.

After installation:

1. Open SideStore once.
2. Keep Developer Mode and Background App Refresh enabled.
3. Connect the official LocalDevVPN and keep the iPhone on Wi-Fi.
4. Open **Settings -> Refreshing Apps -> Refresh Schedule**.
5. Select the required schedule and verify the refresh history after the next run.

iOS controls when a background task runs. The selected time is an earliest eligible time, not a guaranteed alarm time.

## Compatibility

Verified on an iPhone 12 running iOS 26.6.1 with the official App Store LocalDevVPN and a same-subnet `/32` tunnel/device configuration.

Do not share pairing files, Apple credentials, certificate private keys, signed personal IPAs, or complete private device logs.
