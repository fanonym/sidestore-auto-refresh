# Verification Report

> **3.0.2.1 deployment:** See [the frozen baseline and test matrix](RELEASE_NOTES_v3.0.2.1.md)
> and [recommended Shortcuts refresh](../README.md#recommended-refresh-via-shortcuts).
> RPP-only pairing is recommended; internal LC Auto-refresh is unused. True Hairpin
> and CoreDevice/62078 are historical/experimental, not this deployment's recommendation.
> Older release evidence and pending issue-specific checks below retain their original scope;
> they neither override the 3.0.2.1 configuration nor gain new PASS results from its refresh tests.

## 3.0.2.1 verification

The deployment owner reports home Wi-Fi PASS, Wi-Fi 2 PASS, hotspot PASS,
sleep/wake PASS and Shortcuts refresh PASS with RPP-only pairing, Tunnel
`10.7.0.1` / Device-Peer `10.7.0.2`, Use Local VPN ON and Port Override `0`.
Remaining signing lifetime on LC Home is the operating check. LC logs are empty
in this deployment; internal LC Auto-refresh is OFF and unused. See the baseline
release notes for immutable pins, build 36748073104 and its exact IPA checksum.
These are owner-reported device results, separate from local repository checks.

## Historical evidence scope

This report distinguishes standalone SideStore evidence from the combined
LiveContainer + embedded SideStore release. Proof from one variant must not be
assumed to cover the other.

The test setup uses an iPhone 12 running iOS 26.6.1 with a Free Apple
Account, Developer Mode, official App Store LocalDevVPN, Wi-Fi, and a valid
Lockdown pairing file.

The PC is used only for building, initial installation, diagnostics, and log
capture. It is not part of the intended refresh runtime.

## Combined v2.0.0 release

- Published builder: `f20e14e43b4048c5b5791e7d4b0bb6e32930c10a`.
- [Build 34238644076](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/actions/runs/34238644076):
  76 tests, 2 skipped; both Release builds and package/transport checks passed.
- Downloaded IPA independently passed combined semantic/runtime package checks.
- Size: 37,389,675 bytes.
- SHA-256: `1c29648ee99abd67cd6244d0405f2ab9df0beca92adb4c35bed5c133eb7d974e`.
- Earlier device tests observed embedded UI startup, Return-control interaction,
  and transfer of matching refresh verification results. A newly installed host
  provisioning profile was independently observed.
- These observations do not alone prove executable replacement, same-PID guest
  preservation, or unattended combined refresh.
- The final automatic windowed/fullscreen control visibility change has passed
  source/build checks but awaits device confirmation.

See [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0.0.md) for the complete changes and limitations.
The original release tag was retained; use the explicit builder SHA for this IPA.

## Standalone SideStore: proven

- Lockdown reaches CoreDeviceProxy on the LocalDevVPN same-subnet route.
- CoreDeviceProxy service TLS is enabled.
- CDTunnel reaches RSD through the userspace IPv6 adapter.
- Heartbeat Marco/Polo traffic remains active during transport operations.
- AFC stages a real signed IPA through RSD.
- InstallationProxy installs the staged IPA.
- Post-install browsing confirms the installed application.
- SideStore registers and submits the native background processing task.
- A manual `Refresh All` run refreshed Spotify and SideStore successfully over
  the CoreDevice transport in 18.571 seconds.
- Full unattended scheduled refresh with the PC disconnected is verified on the
  current proof device.

## Standalone final PC-free proof

The final proof condition is a scheduled iOS background task running while the
PC and USB are disconnected, then reaching the refresh operation and completing
successfully.

Required non-sensitive proof markers:

```text
[AUTO_REFRESH] TRIGGER source=bgprocessing
[AUTO_REFRESH] AUTH_PREFLIGHT_PASS
[AUTO_REFRESH] OPERATION_START
[AUTO_REFRESH] COMPLETE success=true
```

For external reports, include only non-sensitive evidence:

- iPhone model
- iOS version
- LocalDevVPN remained connected
- PC/USB was disconnected during the scheduled run
- refreshed app names if they are safe to disclose
- screenshot of the refresh history screen after completion
- the public diagnostic markers above

Do not upload pairing files, certificates, private keys, full private device
logs, unnecessary device identifiers, or signed IPAs containing personal signing
material.

## Standalone v1.0.2 IPA

The public **v1.0.2** IPA is **27,566,058 bytes** with SHA-256:

```text
120ba06c51d4d235743451b065968dc94f7c7374cacb955827860254e01b5a76
```

Release provenance:

```text
builder_commit=f33487d473e09620493d2a8d82e8e37c9bdef32b
GitHub Actions run=34045788967
verification=PASS
```

The GitHub release publishes the IPA together with `SHA256SUMS.txt` and
`current-verification.txt`. GitHub's release asset digest for the IPA matches
the SHA-256 above.

## Refresh history build

Builder commit `12c9ffb6f906000f8ad87ce820e64600f71ffc97` passed
[Actions run 33984781809](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/actions/runs/33984781809).
It adds persisted history with **Manual** and **Scheduled** source labels,
manual refresh results, and a local start-alert request for native scheduled
tasks. All eight local tests passed before dispatch. The macOS repository
checks, transport tests, full iOS build, and IPA verification passed in CI.

Tests cover old history decoding, partial failures, missing results, terminal
event deduplication, and the generated manual refresh entry point with mocked
pipeline results. Background callers opt out of manual recording to avoid
duplicate entries. Existing refresh callbacks remain intact.

Local checks confirmed archive integrity and the expected history, start-alert,
and manual-result strings in the executable.

## Schedule UI builds

The configurable Refresh Schedule UI was built successfully from builder
commit `63f1c0d148c999ae7e93546582c3f65968223642` in
[Actions run 33972557213](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/actions/runs/33972557213).
All seven local tests passed, including generated Swift date and scheduler
tests and patch idempotence against the pinned source. The macOS runner also
passed a SwiftUI type check, transport tests, the full iOS build, and IPA
verification.

The downloaded IPA is 27,524,692 bytes with SHA-256:

```text
fb2c3f710a8151296ab82270b8d838c31d98b05ada3df4ac1158f038793b4ec5
```

Its executable contains the schedule screen and preference keys.

Weekly scheduling was added in builder commit
`7e2384709f7beebd87890b6beaf5497dd2310c63` and built successfully in
[Actions run 33980149032](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/actions/runs/33980149032).
The same local and macOS checks passed, with additional cases for weekly
rollover, weekday changes, legacy daily preferences, and daylight-saving
transitions. The verified IPA is 27,530,865 bytes with SHA-256:

```text
cb5691bd04fd18bbf691ab6a8296ab23f1ba2cb7dc3a20a5c710474ecd03d2a3
```

Its executable contains the frequency and weekday preference keys.

## Additional device coverage still useful

The current proof device is verified. Additional community reports are still
valuable for compatibility coverage across:

- other iPhone models
- other iOS versions
- different Wi-Fi subnets, including `10.x`, `172.16.x`-`172.31.x`, and
  `192.168.x`
- six-hour, daily, and weekly schedules
- large text / accessibility settings
- repeated refresh cycles over multiple days
