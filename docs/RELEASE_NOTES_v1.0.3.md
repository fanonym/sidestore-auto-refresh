# SideStore CoreDevice Auto-Refresh v1.0.3

> **3.0.2.1 deployment:** See [the frozen baseline and test matrix](RELEASE_NOTES_v3.0.2.1.md)
> and [recommended Shortcuts refresh](../README.md#recommended-refresh-via-shortcuts).
> RPP-only pairing is recommended; internal LC Auto-refresh is unused. True Hairpin
> and CoreDevice/62078 are historical/experimental, not this deployment's recommendation.
> Older release evidence and pending issue-specific checks below retain their original scope;
> they neither override the 3.0.2.1 configuration nor gain new PASS results from its refresh tests.

Standalone v1.0.3 updates the app to **SideStore 0.7.0 nightly** while preserving this project's LocalDevVPN → Lockdown/CoreDevice → RSD refresh path. Combined LiveContainer remains on its separate v2.1.0 release.

## Changes

- Retains SideStore 0.7's authentication implementation, including its newer SideSign authentication path.
- Adapts the new pairing parser so composite records prefer Lockdown/CoreDevice over RemotePairing.
- Allows the CoreDevice path to use LocalDevVPN's tunnel without an additional IKEv2/IPsec interface.
- Adapts the new signing block while retaining provisioning-profile checks and self-refresh markers.
- Uses the new asynchronous database-startup API for scheduled refresh; the older combined build retains its callback API.
- Prevents a database save error from producing a successful self-refresh reconciliation marker.
- Preserves manual and scheduled refresh, history, retry/recovery behavior, cancellation, and verification diagnostics.
- Corrects repository security checks so legitimate source filenames are accepted while sensitive artifact paths remain rejected across public branches, tags, and reachable history.

The app reports version `0.7.0`, build `0700`; `v1.0.3` identifies this project's standalone release.

## Validation

[Release CI run 34613911507](https://github.com/NRG-Wardog/sidestore-auto-refresh/actions/runs/34613911507) completed successfully:

- 83 repository tests passed in macOS CI. Two additional LiveContainer tests were skipped because their fixture lookup used a fixed local path; both subsequently passed locally against the pinned fixtures.
- 14 Rust transport tests passed. The existing `local_tcp` and `handle_speed` tests remained filtered out.
- The full standalone patch chain applied twice without further changes. Executable Swift checks covered pairing selection, both database-startup APIs, startup failures, task expiry, and self-refresh reconciliation.
- SideStore authentication sources and the pinned SideSign dependency were verified unchanged by the patches.
- The arm64 iOS archive, IPA packaging, and final feature-marker checks passed.
- The published download independently passed SHA-256, ZIP integrity, app metadata, background-task configuration, and all 13 required feature-marker checks.

IPA: `SideStore-CoreDevice-AutoRefresh-v1.0.3.ipa`

SHA-256: `ab35772fe3209618c7bec302e315faea0a35b7ae280edfb9b5390d2aa62c8940`

Device testing of this exact build is pending. Earlier standalone device evidence in [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md) predates v1.0.3.

## Updating

Install the standalone IPA over the existing matching SideStore installation using the same Apple Account / Personal Team and identifiers. Keep the existing installation to preserve its data and configuration.

Follow the [standalone setup instructions](../README.md#standalone-setup-v1). The supported setup uses Wi-Fi and the official LocalDevVPN. Cellular-only refresh remains experimental, and iOS controls when scheduled background tasks run.
